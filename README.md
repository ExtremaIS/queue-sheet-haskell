## Overview

Queue Sheet is a utility that builds PDFs of lists.  Printed PDFs can be used
to track progress when offline.

Use Queue Sheet to track:

* podcasts
* research papers
* conference videos
* university lectures

## CLI

### Requirements

Queue Sheet has only been tested on Linux.  It *might* work on Windows and
macOS.

Queue Sheet uses [XeTeX][] to build PDFs.  It is usually installed as part of
[TeX Live][].  The LaTeX packages used depend entirely on the contents of the
template.
