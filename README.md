## Overview

Queue Sheet is a utility that builds PDFs of lists.  Printed PDFs can be used
to track progress when offline.

Use Queue Sheet to track:

* podcasts
* research papers
* conference videos
* university lectures

## CLI

### Requirements

Queue Sheet has only been tested on Linux.  It *might* work on Windows and
macOS.

Queue Sheet uses [XeTeX][] to build PDFs.  It is usually installed as part of
[TeX Live][].  The LaTeX packages used depend entirely on the contents of the
template.

[XeTeX]: <https://tug.org/xetex/>
[TeX Live]: <https://www.tug.org/texlive/>

### Installation

#### `.deb` Package Installation

Check the [Releases][] page for `.deb` packages.

[Releases]: <https://github.com/ExtremaIS/queue-sheet-haskell/releases>

#### `.rpm` Package Installation

Check the [Releases][] page for `.rpm` packages.

#### Installation From Hackage

Install Queue Sheet from [Hackage][] using [Cabal][] as follows:

```
$ cabal v2-install queue-sheet
```

[Hackage]: <https://hackage.haskell.org/package/queue-sheet>
[Cabal]: <https://www.haskell.org/cabal/>

#### Installation From Stackage

Install Queue Sheet from [Stackage][] using [Stack][] as follows:

```
$ stack install queue-sheet
```

[Stackage]: <https://www.stackage.org/package/queue-sheet>

### Branches

The `main` branch is reserved for releases.  It may be considered stable, and
`HEAD` is always the latest release.

The `develop` branch is the primary development branch.  It contains changes
that have not yet been released, and it is not necessarily stable.

[Hackage revisions][] are made for metadata changes, such as relaxation of
constraints when new versions of dependencies are released.  The
`queue-sheet.cabal` metadata in the `main` branch may therefore not match that
of Hackage.  The `queue-sheet.cabal` metadata in the `develop` branch may
match, *unless* work is being done on a new release that contains other
changes.

### Tags

All releases are tagged in the `main` branch.  Release tags are signed using
the
[`security@extrema.is` GPG key][].

[`security@extrema.is` GPG key]: <https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x1D484E4B4705FADF&fingerprint=on&op=index>
