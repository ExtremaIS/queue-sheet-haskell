# `queue-sheet-haskell` `0.2.0.0` Release Notes

Date
: 2020-08-11

## Overview

This release of Queue Sheet adds support for associating URLs with queues as
well as queue items.  This allows others to easily access the media when a
Queue Sheet PDF is shared.  See the updated man page and example for details.

YAML files used with version `0.1.0.0` work with version `0.2.0.0` without
change, but YAML files that include URLs will not work with version `0.1.0.0`.
