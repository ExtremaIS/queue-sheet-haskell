## History

One needs to find a good balance between creation and consumption.  While I
prioritize creation, consumption is also valuable when it exposes you to new
ideas.  I try to maximize creation when on a computer, so I am usually offline
when I consume.  For many years, I have used printed queue sheets to track
progress through podcasts, lectures, etc. while commuting/traveling, doing
chores, etc.  I prefer to minimize usage of paper, so I tend to update the
printed sheets by pen and use them for many months before synchronizing the
digital version and printing new sheets.

I created my first queue sheets using LibreOffice, which required the least
investment of time.  When I got a chance, I created this program so that I can
use plain text, which is easier to edit and works better with revision
control.

## Name

Naming things is difficult, and I did not want to spend time on determining a
good name for this program.  I chose the first name that came to mind, as a
search does not find any existing software with the same name.

## Design Notes

This utility is a quick hack.  I did not spend much time worrying about the
design, as I just wanted to use the result.
