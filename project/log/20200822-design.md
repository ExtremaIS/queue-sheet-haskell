## Sharing

Queue sheets are convenient for tracking progress through conference videos
and university lectures.  I would like to share those that I make with others,
and I made the following major design changes to make the program easier for
multiple people to work with:

* Support was added for a "default" section, for queue sheets that do not need
  sections.  One can specify the queue list as a top-level array to simplify
  queue files in this case.
* Support was added for importing other queue files, either inheriting
  sections or overriding them.  This allows users to easily create a custom
  queue sheet that includes queues defined in separate files.
* Support was added for associating URLS with queues as well as queue items.
  This makes it easy for users to easily locate the media indexed by a queue.

## User-Defined Tags

Support was added for user-defined tags, which can be handled in any way that
the user wants in the template.  This simplifies the design of the program yet
makes it more flexible.

The initial design used a special "split" flag, intended to be used to display
items on separate lines.  This flag has been removed, as the same
functionality can be implemented using a "split" tag.
